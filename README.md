# FUD-builder
You can find an already compiled version of the builder in the release tab on the right. Check the rel description for instructions. <br />
This is a builder that will compile a fully undetectable stub. <br />
When run, the stub will grab and send to the webhook previously specified information about the target's IP, Discord Token, crypto wallets, stored passwords, cookies and search history.
Supported browsers: <br />
-Chrome <br />
-Firefox <br />
-Opera GX <br />
I am not to be held responsible by any damage caused by the missuse of this application as i'm only sharing this for research purposes.

As you can see here, a stub builded with this tool is fully-undetectable
